I exported the database with around 50 votes and 10 employees of data.

You can import that database with the data or you got to http://localhost/Pabau/DB/DB.php and a database will be generated with no data but then you have to add the mannualy in phpmyadmin or whatever you are using.
But then you will have to mannualy go back to http://localhost/Pabau.

The generate certificate button generates a pdf certificate in that category with some basic info.

I have fixed all possible bugs, so running the project there
should'nt be problems.

Thats about all if you have any question you can email me.
